## ***Introduction***

In the last decade alone, the amount of data and code that has been created or studied is immense. All this needs to stored in an organized fashion in order for it to hold any value. Furthermore, it is important to understand that scientific research is predominantly done in groups, which requires constant sharing, and verification, which mandates that the process can be reiterated. Most importantly, all this must be executed in the most time-efficient and clean method possible. 

With the advent of open science and data science as a field in its entirety, the concepts of collaboration and reproducibility have become paramount to the evolution of the field. This paper throws light on the plethora of tools that facilitate the sharing of data and code as well as make it easier to replicate one’s processes. The five tools that we will be looking into are Makefile, Git, Github, pandoc and Markdown. 

All 5 tools were used to create the Github repository for this project. So, while creating the repository, this paper will contain my reflections on using the tools. For example, questions like ‘What were the easy and difficult parts in using the tools?’, ‘How long it took to understand the concepts and syntax?’ and the most important question – ‘How is this tool significant in reproducibility and collaboration in data science?’ It should be noted that in order to utilize all these tools, bash was used on the Terminal to execute all the commands.
