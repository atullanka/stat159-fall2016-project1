## ***Conclusion***

From the thorough analysis and step-by-step explanation of each tool, as well as my opinions on each one when it comes to each of use, it becomes clear that while these tools might have certain features that might not be obvious at first and need time for one to acclimatize to, each tool has a specific role in this reproducibility project and facilitates in the efficient sharing and merging of files, just like how the various sections of this paper merged to created the entire document paper.md using Makefile. Overall, there are certainly other ways to create this repository, convert the files and merge them. However, it can be tedious and the tools only make it easier and faster â€“ writing one line of code to convert or merge documents definitely saves a lot more time and being able to track changes on Github allows a user to revert back to previous versions of the project if the circumstances dictate so.
