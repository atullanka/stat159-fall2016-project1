## ***Abstract***

This paper explains and evaluates five tools that are relevant to the topic and reproducibility and collaboration in data science, as well as this project in particular. The tools this paper will delve into are Makefile, Git, Github, pandoc and Markdown. The paper will serve as a tutorial and a product review of sorts in order to enlighten the readers about how one can collaborate, reproduce and along the way, track changes of their work in a more efficient manner. 

The first section will focus on Makefile and its impact on being able to recreate previous work. Furthermore, the paper will summarize the basics of Makefile in terms of how to create a target file using one or several dependencies and certain syntax to keep in mind. 

The second section is centered around Git and its significance in being able to track changes in one’s work in case one the has to navigate through the work’s history – which in turn helps with reproducing work. Basics of Git and features of the tool that must be kept in mind will also be examined. 

This seamlessly would introduce Github and how is it relevant to this very project and topic of collaboration in general. Setting up a Github account and learning how to create a repository and sync it to a remote repository on your laptop using Git is the primary content of this section

The next section will comment on pandoc’s utility, both for this project in specific and outside of it. Pandoc is a tool that helps in converting various types with minimal formatting disruptions and so learning its fundamentals theoretically and its syntax is crucial. 

Lastly, the final section will explain what Markdown is and why it is importance as a writing and conversion tool for web writers. The syntax is unique and this paper will list all the necessary syntax that is required for both this project and in general. 

Readers should realize that all these tools were used to complete this project and so, this paper is essentially a continuous review of the tools as I’m using them – a paper about how I write this paper and create a repository with all the necessary files.
